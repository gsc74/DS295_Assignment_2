# DS295 Assignment 2 Verification

```bash
# Get code and make it run
git clone https://github.com/gsc74/DS295_Assignment_2.git
cd code
make

# Run the script
vtx=1 # This is source vertex
./SSSP $vtx  
mv ../output/ouput_1.bin mv ../output/ouput_1_GS.bin
./SSSP_Sarthak
# give source vertex as input
mv ../output/ouput_1.bin mv ../output/ouput_1_SJ.bin

# Compare the output
./ComparerSSSP ../output/ouput_1_GS.bin ../output/ouput_1_SJ.bin
```
The comparer will compare the paths generated by these two codes and report if there exist paths with same weights.\
As there are alternate paths with the same weights in the graph, the comparer will also print out whenever it identifies a different path with same weight as compared to our generated output. These alternate path prints can be safely ignored. In case of wrong weights the comparer will print "Weight mismatch" and stop.

## Instructions (vtx = source vertex)
 1) Generate the output using your code and rename output_vtx.bin to output_vtx_test.bin 
 2) Generate the output using our code (either use SSSP or SSSP_Sarthak) and  get output_vtx.bin  
 3) Use comparer to compare output_vtx_test.bin with output_vtx.bin

## Evaluation
 1) Establish the correction of the sequential and parallel codes for the vertices 500 and 10000.
 2) Show the speedup of your parallel code against your sequential code.
